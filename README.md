## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
1. **Check Sidebar Panel**:
   - Look for ClickUp icon in Activity Bar (left side of VS Code)
   - Click icon to open sidebar and check authentication status
   - Use "Login to ClickUp" button if not connected

2. **Check Extension is Active**:
   - Look for "ClickUp Link extension activated!" notification
   - Check the "ClickUp Link Debug" output panel for activation logs

3. **Reload Extension Development Host**:
   - Press `Ctrl+R` in the Extension Development Host window
   - Or close and restart with `F5`

### Authentication Issues  
1. **Sidebar Authentication**:
   - Open ClickUp sidebar panel 
   - Click "Login to ClickUp" button instead of using Command Palette
   - Check if "‚úÖ Connected to ClickUp" appears after login

2. **Connection Problems**:
   - Check Authentication section in sidebar
   - If not connected, click "Login to ClickUp" button
   - Or use Command Palette: `ClickUp: Login`

3. **Manual Code Entry**:
   - If OAuth redirect fails, use Command Palette: `ClickUp: Enter Authorization Code`
   - Copy the code from your browser manually

### Task References Not Showing
1. **Check Sidebar References Section**:
   - Open ClickUp sidebar panel
   - Look at "Task References" section for summary
   - Expand "Files with References" to see individual files
   - If empty, use "Add New Reference" button

2. **Check Debug Output**:
   - Use sidebar "Actions" ‚Üí "Show All References (Debug)"  
   - Or Command Palette: `ClickUp: Debug - Show Stored Task References`
   - View output in "ClickUp Link Debug" panel

3. **References Not Persisting**:
   - Check if you're in the same workspace
   - References are file-specific and workspace-specific
   - Verify files haven't been moved or renamed

4. **CodeLens Not Appearing**:
   - Ensure you added references with `Ctrl+C+U` 
   - Only manually added references show CodeLens (not every "clickup" word)
   - Check if file type supports CodeLens

### Performance Issues
1. **Clear Old References**:
   - Run: `ClickUp: Debug - Clear All Task References`
   - Add only the references you actually need

2. **Check Network Connection**:
   - ClickUp API calls require internet access
   - Check firewall settings if requests fail

## üîç Debug Panel

The extension includes a dedicated debug output panel for transparency:

**Access Debug Panel**:
1. Go to View ‚Üí Output  
2. Select "ClickUp Link Debug" from the dropdown
3. All extension activity, errors, and persistence data is logged here

**What You'll See**:
- Extension activation logs
- Authentication status changes  
- Task reference creation/deletion
- API call results
- Error messages and stack traces
- Raw persistence data
